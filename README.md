# Sort Containers

## Project Description

### What it does
Sort Containers is an application used to correctly sort garbage into their respective containers. Using a virtual environment like Quanser, we are able to acheive this through the use of color and line sensors.

### Technology Used
- Python
- Quanser Virtual Environment

### Challenges Faced
Some of the challenges I faced
- Color sensor not working on a specific bin color --> I fixed this by manually changing the bin color
- Hardcoding everything into the main method --> Fixed this by creating separate functions and calling them into the main function
- Line sensors glitching --> Fixed this by setting the bot to sleep to act as a reset
